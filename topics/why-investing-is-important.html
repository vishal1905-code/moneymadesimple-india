<h1>Why Investing Is Important</h1>

<h2>1. Saving Alone Is Not Enough</h2>
<p>
Many people believe that saving money is enough. Saving is important, but it does
not help your money grow significantly. When money stays idle, its value slowly
reduces over time.
</p>

<h2>2. Effect of Inflation</h2>
<p>
Inflation means the price of goods and services increases every year. What you can
buy today with ₹100 may cost ₹120 in the future.
</p>
<p>
If your money does not grow faster than inflation, you actually lose purchasing
power. Investing helps your money beat inflation.
</p>

<h2>3. Investing Helps You Build Wealth</h2>
<p>
Investing allows your money to grow over time through compounding. Compounding means
your earnings also start earning money.
</p>
<p>
This is how long-term wealth is created — slowly, steadily, and smartly.
</p>

<h2>4. Helps Achieve Life Goals</h2>
<p>
Whether it is buying a house, funding education, starting a business, or retiring
comfortably, investing helps you achieve these goals without financial stress.
</p>

<h2>5. Important Things to Remember</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Start investing early for better results</li>
  <li>Be patient and stay invested long-term</li>
  <li>Do not expect quick profits</li>
  <li>Always understand where you invest</li>
</ul>
