<h1>SIP Explained Simply</h1>

<h2>What is SIP?</h2>
<p>
SIP stands for Systematic Investment Plan. It is a method of investing a fixed
amount of money regularly, usually every month, into mutual funds.
</p>
<p>
Instead of investing a big amount at once, SIP allows you to invest small
amounts over time.
</p>

<h2>How SIP Works</h2>
<p>
In SIP, a fixed amount is automatically invested from your bank account
every month. This amount is used to buy units of a mutual fund at the current
market price.
</p>
<p>
When markets are high, you buy fewer units. When markets are low, you buy more
units. Over time, this balances the cost of investment.
</p>

<h2>Why SIP is Popular in India</h2>
<p>
SIP is popular because it is simple, flexible, and suitable for beginners.
You do not need market knowledge or large savings to start.
</p>

<h2>Benefits of SIP</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Helps build investing discipline</li>
  <li>Reduces risk of market timing</li>
  <li>Affordable – can start with small amounts</li>
  <li>Works well for long-term goals</li>
</ul>

<h2>Is SIP Risk-Free?</h2>
<p>
No investment is completely risk-free. SIP reduces risk but does not remove it.
Returns depend on the type of mutual fund and market performance.
</p>

<h2>Important Things to Remember</h2>
<ul>
  <li>SIP is a method, not an investment</li>
  <li>Best suited for long-term investing</li>
  <li>Do not stop SIP during market falls</li>
  <li>Consistency is more important than amount</li>
</ul>
