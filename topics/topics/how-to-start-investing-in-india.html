<h1>How to Start Investing in India</h1>

<h2>Who Should Start Investing?</h2>
<p>
Anyone who earns money or saves money should think about investing.
You do not need to be rich to start investing. Even small amounts are enough
if you start early and stay consistent.
</p>

<h2>Step 1: Build Basic Savings First</h2>
<p>
Before investing, make sure you have some savings for emergencies.
This money should be kept safe and easily accessible.
</p>
<p>
Investing without emergency savings can force you to sell investments at the
wrong time.
</p>

<h2>Step 2: Set Clear Goals</h2>
<p>
Ask yourself why you want to invest. Goals could be buying a house, education,
retirement, or financial independence.
</p>
<p>
Clear goals help you choose the right type of investment.
</p>

<h2>Step 3: Start with Simple Investments</h2>
<p>
As a beginner in India, it is better to start with simple options like
mutual funds or SIPs instead of directly jumping into stocks.
</p>

<h2>Step 4: Invest Regularly</h2>
<p>
Regular investing is better than investing large amounts once.
Small monthly investments build discipline and reduce risk.
</p>

<h2>Step 5: Think Long Term</h2>
<p>
Investing works best when given time. Short-term ups and downs are normal.
Patience is one of the most important skills in investing.
</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes Beginners Should Avoid</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Chasing quick profits</li>
  <li>Following tips blindly</li>
  <li>Panicking during market falls</li>
  <li>Investing without understanding</li>
</ul>

<h2>Important Things to Remember</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Start early, even with small amounts</li>
  <li>Consistency matters more than timing</li>
  <li>Do not invest money you may need urgently</li>
</ul>
